## Description

It is a very basic calculator written in OCaml, Sedlex and Menhir.


## Run

Compile the files:

```bash
$ chmod 777 build.sh

$ ./build.sh
```

Run the executable:

```bash
$ ./calc
```

Then you could write expressions such as `2+3`, `4*5`, and press `Enter` (and eventually `Ctrl+D`) to check the result.
